Core Abstraction
================

This module defines the abstraction layers for our core providers and their
implementations. For further information, please refer to
:ref:`architecture` and the :ref:`providers` section of the documentation.

In most cases, you shouldn't directly use a library that's already covered
by the core abstraction. Always try to use our providers first.
In case we are missing a feature or method, please let us know by
opening a new Bug report instead of relying on your library.

.. warning::
    These are **not** widgets! These are just abstractions of the respective
    functionality. For example, you cannot add a core image to your window.
    You have to use the image **widget** class instead. If you're really
    looking for widgets, please refer to :mod:`kivy.uix` instead.
